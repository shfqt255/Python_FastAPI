Query parameters are values added to the end of a URL to send extra information to the server.

They help filter, search, sort, or limit data without changing the main URL path.

They always come after a question mark (?), and multiple parameters are separated by &.

Example:
/patients?age=20&gender=male

Here:

age = 20

gender = male

These are query parameters.
